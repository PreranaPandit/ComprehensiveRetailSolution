# BLOOD BANK COMMUNITY
> STW300CEM-ANDROID APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT BACK END

## Introduction

Blood bank community is a lifesaving system that simplifies and automates the functionalities of searching blood during any emergency situations which is its main motive. It also includes relevant features such as providing means of communication between blood donors, blood seekers and blood banks. It helps to maintain records of blood donors, recipients and blood stocks in the bank.
