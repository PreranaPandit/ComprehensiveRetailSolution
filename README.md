## REST Client

 REST client is the Retrofit library that is used on the client side to make HTTP request to REST API where REST API is defined as a set of functions which developers can perform requests and receive responses via HTTP protocol such as GET, POST and manymore.
 
### Retrofit

Retrofit is a REST Client for android that makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON via a REST based webservise. It is used for data serialization that uses OkHttp library for HTTP requests.

### Using Retrofit

There are basically three classes to work with Retrofit.

- Model class which is used to map the JSON data.
- Interfaces which defines the possible HTTP operations.
- Retrofit.Builder class - Instance which uses the interface and the Builder API which allows defining the URL end point for the HTTP operation.
